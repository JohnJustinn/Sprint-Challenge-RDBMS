1. Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.

    * RDBMS is the acronym Relational Database Management System.  This is an application that retrieves and stores and analyzes data between the    client and the server.
    * SQL is the language used to communicate with the Database Management System.

2. Why do tables need a `primary key`?

    * Because by making each row in a table unique, it makes this unique identify available to other items in the table, as well as aids in quick    organization and identifiction within the data structure. 

3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key
   on another table.

   * Foreign Key

4. What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two
   tables.

   * A unique table with its own row primary keys, as well as foreign keys referencing the two tables to be linked in this relationship.

5. What SQL statement is used to retrieve data from a table?

    * SELECT * FROM (name of table from which data is to be retrived).

6. What SQL clause is used to filter the results of a query?

    * Where is the keyword used. 

7. What are `views`? Provide one example use case for them.

    * A virtual table storing the results of a query to a particular table in the database.
